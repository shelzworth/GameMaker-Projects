GameMaker Projects

Sheldon Cerejo

These are a few of my assignments I created in the first year of being introduced to programming in high school.
These are assignments I created in 10th grade with an application called "GameMaker". Although it was not proper programming it would pave the way 
to me learning and developing full scale projects throughout high school. 

The scrolling shooter being my attempt at a space invader type game.

And the CPT2.0 being my final project in the year, using custom made pixel art and animations. 

Although using GameMaker did not teach me much in terms of hard coding and programming languages it taught me a lot on how to think as a programmer. Using GameMaker taught me some basic programming principles such as making the application interactive and developing problem solving skills when dealing with problems and flaws in my game designs. This would ultimately transition well into debugging software in the coming years.

To view the files you must have a version of GameMaker downloaded.
